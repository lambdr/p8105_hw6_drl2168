### Load packages

``` r
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)


# Set default figure options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

# Problem 1

I imported the data using similar code to that which I wrote in HW5, but
with a few additional cleaning steps for this problem. The final data
set considers only 5 variables: the city & state of the homicide,
whether the case was solved, and victim demographics (age, race, sex).

``` r
df_homicide <- read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv", 
                        na = "Unknown") |> 
  mutate(
    state = str_to_upper(state),
    city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
    solved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ 1,
      disposition != "Closed by arrest" ~ 0
    )
    ) |> 
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Tulsa, AL", "Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO"),
         victim_race %in% c("Black", "White")) |> 
  select(city_state, victim_age, victim_sex, victim_race, solved)
```

    ## Warning: One or more parsing issues, call `problems()` on your data frame for details,
    ## e.g.:
    ##   dat <- vroom(...)
    ##   problems(dat)

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (8): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_sex, city, stat...
    ## dbl (4): reported_date, victim_age, lat, lon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Now I will fit a logistic regression model to predict the odds of cases
being solved by victim demographics.

``` r
bmore_model = 
  df_homicide |> 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") |> 
  glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex,
      family = binomial,
      data = _)
```

This model is stored within R. I will use `tidy()` from the `broom`
package to examine it further. Calculating the adjusted odds ratios and
confidence intervals in a tidy format was challenging, so I created the
function below to add the values of interest to an input dataframe.

``` r
or_ci = function(df){
  df = 
    df |> 
    mutate(
      ci_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error),
      or = exp(estimate),
      ci_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error)
    )
  
  return(df)
}
```

Now I will apply the `or_ci` function to the logistic regression model
for Baltimore, MD.

``` r
bmore_or_sex = 
  bmore_model |> 
  tidy() |> 
  or_ci() |> 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") |> 
  select(ci_lower:ci_upper)
```

The adjusted odds ratio for sex on homicide is 0.43 (95% CI: 0.32,
0.56), this means that when the homicide victim is male in Baltimore,
MD, the case is 57% less likely to be solved than when the victim is
female, holding other demographic variables constant.

To apply this approach to the entire `df_homicide` dataframe, I will
create a second function to do the processing steps outlined in the
previous code chunk.

``` r
clean_or = function(df){
  df = 
    df |> 
    tidy() |> 
    or_ci() |> 
    filter(term == "victim_sexMale") |> 
    select(ci_lower:ci_upper)
  
  return(df)
}
```

To check that this still works, I will again apply it to the Baltimore
model.

``` r
bmore_model |> 
  clean_or()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 3
    ##   ci_lower    or ci_upper
    ##      <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>
    ## 1    0.325 0.426    0.558

It still works. Now I will do this for the entire dataset, using `map`
functions.
